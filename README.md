# Fragment-with-Animation

1. Since Fragment has default animation which called as slide animation that's why we have an animation by default so I've learned from the android documentation that we can input another animation in our fragment but we should implements PageTransform and override the methods called transformPage get the width and height of the page in order that
you can scale it :)

As you can see here the image below this is the animation in the fragment
